#  Health Gorilla builds tools for developers that make building healthcare products easier than ever before.

Health Gorilla is expanding the tools available to our developer community!  Developer code examples, postman collections, and other great resources have been added to the GitHub healthgorilla repository.  This developer platform is a complement to the robust API docs and guides available on the Health Gorilla website.  Health Gorilla will continue to add to the repository of development tools and encourage the community to post their non-propritary codes as well.

In this directory, you can find resources for:
- [Patient360 API](https://github.com/healthgorilla/examples/tree/main/Patient360) requests to help you access data in Health Gorilla
- [FHIR STU3](https://github.com/healthgorilla/examples/tree/main/FHIR%20STU3) resources, which provide additional API calls to refine your searches
- [CPOE](https://github.com/healthgorilla/examples/tree/main/CPOE) resources, which will help refine your CPOE ordering and results experience
