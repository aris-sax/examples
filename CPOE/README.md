# Health Gorilla CPOE

Health Gorilla's Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) platform provides clients the ability to place orders and receive results directly with labs and facilities. Our API suite allows clients the flexibility to make this work through their own ecosystem.
In this directory, we provide:
- Round trip order & result JSON examples
- Other CPOE workflow and JSON examples (to follow soon)
